# Security Advisory 2022-09-06

## Summary

Yearn vaults in versions lower than 0.4.4 and the [WOOFY](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd0660cd418a64a1d44e9214ad8e459324d8157f1) token have the permit function vulnerable to replay attacks [[1]](#References) in `PoW` fork-networks. If you use permit in WOOFY token and/or yearn vaults with this versions we strongly recommend the following:

- Yearn discourages the usage of permit method in WOOFY token and in yearn vaults within other forked networks. Yearn does not plan to support any ethereum proof-of-work fork post-merge and can't vouch for correct functionality of vaults in other networks beside the officially supported ones.
- Reset the allowance using the `approve(spender, 0)` function if the `permit` function was used previously in the Ethereum mainnet.
- Use a non-infinite expiry deadline.

## Background

The Ethereum community is now just weeks away from their most important event, the merge. However, we need to be cautious when we interact with DeFi protocols before the merge due to the replay attacks [[1]](#References).

## Details of issue

The `permit` function allows a wallet approves another spender wallet to expend tokens using the wallet's owner's signature.

When the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is calculated at contract deployment, it is possible to execute a replay attack in another PoW fork-network.

More details on the EIP-2612 [[2]](#References),

> If the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR contains the chainId and is defined at contract deployment instead of reconstructed for every signature, there is a risk of possible replay attacks between chains in the event of a future chain split.

## Details of fix

The Yearn vaults support the EIP-2612 [[3]](#References), and the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is calculated at contract deployment [[4]](#references) in the version on Ethereum mainnet.

More details about the changes included in the [0.4.3](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/tree/v0.4.3) and [0.4.4-rc-1](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/tree/v0.4.4-rc-2) releases.

Our recommendations for the users are:

- Yearn discourages the usage of permit method in [WOOFY](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd0660cd418a64a1d44e9214ad8e459324d8157f1) token and yearn vaults within other forked networks. Yearn does not plan to support any ethereum proof-of-work fork post-merge and can't vouch for correct functionality of vaults in other networks beside the officially supported ones.
- Reset the allowance using the `approve(spender, 0)` function if the `permit` function was used previously in the Ethereum mainnet.
- Use a non-infinite expiry deadline.
